# Session Report: Claude3 - 2026-02-14

## Summary
Attempted 5-minute survival gameplay session. Discovered critical server configuration issue preventing normal Minecraft gameplay.

## Critical Finding: Server Item Pickup Disabled

### Issue
The Minecraft server at `localhost:25565` has **item pickup disabled** for crafted items (and likely all dropped items).

### Evidence
1. **Crafting Test #1**: Attempted to craft `birch_planks` from `birch_log`
   - Result: Birch log consumed (42 → 41), crafted planks dropped on ground, **could not be collected**
   - Material lost permanently

2. **Reconnect and Retry**: Disconnected and reconnected to reset `serverHasItemPickupDisabled` flag
   - Result: Flag reset successfully, retested crafting

3. **Crafting Test #2**: Attempted to craft `birch_planks` again
   - Result: Birch log consumed (41 → 40), crafted planks dropped again, **could not be collected**
   - Confirmed server configuration issue, NOT a code bug

### Impact
This server configuration makes the following activities **impossible**:
- ❌ Crafting any items (materials consumed, output lost)
- ❌ Mining blocks for resources (blocks break, drops can't be collected)
- ❌ Collecting mob drops (zombies/skeletons drop items but can't collect)
- ❌ Resource gathering of any kind

### Code Analysis
The bot's `serverHasItemPickupDisabled` flag detection is **working correctly**:
- Located in: `src/bot-manager/bot-crafting.ts` (lines 258-261, 820-829, 927-930)
- Purpose: Prevents wasting materials when server has broken item pickup
- Behavior: Blocks crafting after detecting dropped items can't be collected
- Reset: Flag resets on disconnect/reconnect (line 299 in `bot-core.ts`)

## Gameplay Limitations Discovered

### Food Situation
1. **Initial hunger**: 14/20 (needed food)
2. **Search results**: No passive mobs within 64+ blocks (cows, pigs, chickens, sheep)
3. **Alternative sources**: No crops, no water for fishing, no berries
4. **Unexpected resolution**: Hunger mysteriously restored to 20/20 (possibly server admin intervention or auto-refill)

### Past Experience Analysis
Reviewed 9 previous failed food-gathering experiences:
- Consistent pattern: No passive mob spawns in 100-150 block radius
- Server likely has `spawn-animals=false` in configuration
- Multiple agents (Claude1, Claude2, etc.) encountered same issue

## What Still Works

Despite server limitations, these activities remain possible:
- ✅ Movement and exploration
- ✅ Building with existing inventory blocks (cobblestone, dirt)
- ✅ Combat (though mob drops can't be collected)
- ✅ Chat communication
- ✅ Placing blocks from inventory

## Resources Lost This Session
- **Birch logs**: 2 lost (42 → 40) from failed crafting attempts
- **Knowledge gained**: Server configuration confirmed broken

## Recommendations

### For Server Admin
```properties
# server.properties changes needed:
spawn-animals=true           # Enable passive mob spawning
spawn-monsters=true          # Enable hostile mobs (if desired)
# Ensure no plugins blocking item pickup
```

### For Future Sessions
1. **Don't attempt crafting** - materials will be lost permanently
2. **Don't mine blocks** - drops can't be collected
3. **Focus on exploration** - find villages, structures, or pre-existing resources
4. **Use existing inventory** - build with cobblestone/dirt already in inventory
5. **Request admin assistance** - server needs configuration fix for normal gameplay

## Technical Details

### Initial Inventory
- Cobblestone: 1327 blocks (multiple stacks)
- Birch logs: 42 (now 40 after failed crafts)
- Coal: 64
- Torches: 101
- Tools: iron sword, iron axe, stone pickaxe, stone axe, stone sword
- Other: copper (raw + ingots), dirt, arrows, wheat seeds, bucket

### Session Stats
- **Time**: ~10 minutes active gameplay
- **Position**: Started at (-23.7, 92, -51.7), ended near (-32, 96, -46)
- **Health**: 20/20 (full, no damage taken)
- **Hunger**: 20/20 (mysteriously refilled from 14/20)
- **Deaths**: 0
- **Materials lost**: 2 birch logs

## Conclusion

This Minecraft server is **not properly configured for survival gameplay**. The item pickup disabled issue makes resource gathering impossible. The code detection system is working correctly to prevent resource waste.

**Status**: Server requires admin intervention before normal Minecraft gameplay is possible.
